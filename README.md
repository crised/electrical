==========

Electrical M2M software to get an Electrical Bill approximation


2 Projects for now, running different servers:

1. JBoss App Server, that eats the data.
2. Mock of the ARM Device, that POSTS electrical variable.


EJB, CDI, Entities, JAX-RS, Arquillian. 

PostgreSQL on backend.

We will move to Java EE 7 eventually.
